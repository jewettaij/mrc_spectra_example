===========

## Example comparing image spectra from multiple MRC (3D) volumetric images

This short repository contains two different MRC file images.
It also contains a jupyter notebook explaining how to use the mrcfile, numpy,
and matplotlib modules to (visually) compare the spectra of the two images.
(An additional python script file was included containing instructions how
 the images which were used in this example were prepared.  It is an
 executable and it can be run from the terminal.)

This short repository was meant as a demonstration for coworkers
and was not intended for the public.

## Requirements

These examples require the numpy, matplotlib, mrcfile python modules as well
as jupyter (if you plan to open the .ipynb file).

## License

The code in this short example is in the public domain.
